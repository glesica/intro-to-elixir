# Intro To Elixir

George Lesica <george@lesica.com>

Slides, notes, and demo code for my talk entitled "Introduction to the Elixir
Programming Language".

The following tools are needed in order to build the slides and take full
advantage of the code samples, etc.

  * Pandoc (>=1.12.2.1) - to build the slides
  * Elixir (>=0.13.2) - to run the example code
  * Ansible (>=1.5.4) - to use the setup playbook

## Building the materials

To build everything, just run `make`.
